Adult participation in lifelong learning is also the lowest in the EU (4.9%). Digital STARs directly addresses this gap by equipping citizens with essential skills for personal, civic, and professional life. The program is part of Romania’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), modernizing libraries in all 42 counties and strengthening employability, e-government use, and social inclusion. <br><br>Its scalable design makes it a model for other countries facing similar challenges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edskills.org/evidence-digital-stars/\">For more detail, view the <em>evidence and case studies</em> page for this program.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Program screenshots</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.49.png\" data-size=\"1276x985\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.49-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Digital STARs Moodle screenshot\" width=\"768\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Digital STARs Moodle screenshot</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.40.png\" data-size=\"1276x985\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.40-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Digital STARs Moodle screenshot\" width=\"768\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Digital STARs Moodle screenshot</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.27.png\" data-size=\"1276x985\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://edskills.org/media/posts/10/gallery/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.45.27-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Digital STARs Moodle screenshot - pretest\" width=\"768\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Digital STARs Moodle screenshot - pretest</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3><strong>Downloads and links</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://edskills.org/media/files/Digital STARs_one pager_v2.pdf\">Program overview (PDF)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edskills.org/RAS Digital Skills_final presentation.pdf\">Romania Digital Skills RAS presentation (PDF)</a>: Maximizing the uptake, outcomes and benefits stemming from the digital economy</li>\n<li>Librarian training handbooks – <i>coming soon</i></li>\n<li>Course demo – <a href=\"https://digitalstars.neting.hu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Access here</a> (Username: <code>wb_student</code>, Password: <code>DigitalStars2025!</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Contact</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">For more information or to adapt this program in your country, contact:</p>\n<p><strong>Alina Sava</strong> – <i>Senior Education Specialist, World Bank</i><br><a href=\"mailto:asava@worldbank.org\">asava@worldbank.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>Cristóbal Cobo</strong> – <i>Senior Education Specialist, World Bank</i><br><a href=\"mailto:ccobo@worldbank.org\">ccobo@worldbank.org</a></p>",
