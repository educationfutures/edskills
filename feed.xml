<p>The Digital STARs Program is Romania’s flagship initiative to close the digital divide. By 2026, it will train 100,000 citizens in basic digital skills, turning public libraries into community learning hubs. The program combines a life-centered curriculum, a blended learning model, and a nationwide training-of-trainers cascade to ensure no one is left behind in the digital transition.</p>
<h3><strong>Who this tool is for</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Citizens with little or no digital skills, including women, youth, Roma, rural residents, pensioners, and the unemployed.</li>
<li>Librarians and local facilitators who deliver training as community mentors.</li>
<li>Schools, ministries, and NGOs seeking scalable models for digital inclusion.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Digital Skills Training:</strong> A 60-hour blended course aligned with Romania’s new DigCompRo framework, covering six key competence areas and 23 skills.</li>
<li><strong>Life-centered curriculum:</strong> Three tracks – <em>Personal Life, Civic Life, Professional Life</em> – ensure skills are applied in everyday contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Training-of-Trainers (ToT):</strong> A cascade model (20 master trainers → 700 librarians → 100,000 citizens) that empowers local mentors.</li>
<li><strong>Modernized libraries:</strong> Over 1,100 libraries equipped with high-speed internet, computers, and trained staff as digital hubs.</li>
<li><strong>Learning platform:</strong> A dedicated LMS with self-reflection tools, activities, and online resources to support hybrid learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to use it</strong></h3>
<ol class="ordered-list">
<li class="p1">Select and train librarians through the ToT program.</li>
<li>Enroll citizens through public libraries and community outreach campaigns.</li>
<li>Deliver the 60-hour blended course (online + in-person), applying modules to daily life events.</li>
<li>Support learners with mentoring, hands-on practice, and peer-to-peer interaction.</li>
<li>Monitor progress using built-in assessments and DigCompRo-based self-reflection questions.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://edskills.org/how-to-guide-digital-stars/">For more detail, view the <em>how-to guide</em> for this program.</a></p>
<h3><strong>Time and effort</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Setup: Train master trainers and librarians (Nov 2024–Apr 2025).</li>
<li>Instruction: Citizens complete 60 hours of training, paced flexibly across 2–3 months.</li>
<li>Support: Ongoing mentoring, coaching for librarians, and national webinars through June 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Languages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Available in <strong>Romanian</strong>.</li>
<li>Adaptable to other languages with translation and localization.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Evidence and impact</strong></h3>
<p class="p3">Romania ranks last in the EU in basic digital skills (28% vs. 54% EU average). Adult participation in lifelong learning is also the lowest in the EU (4.9%). Digital STARs directly addresses this gap by equipping citizens with essential skills for personal, civic, and professional life. The program is part of Romania’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), modernizing libraries in all 42 counties and strengthening employability, e-government use, and social inclusion. <br><br>Its scalable design makes it a model for other countries facing similar challenges.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://edskills.org/media/posts/4/RO1.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Image depicting graph paper, geometric shapes, and a compass" /></p>
                <p class="msg msg--warning"><em>Note</em>: These resources are currently available in the Romanian language.</p>
<p>The Remedial Math Program gives students who are falling behind a second chance to succeed. Built in Romania and piloted in vulnerable schools, it combines teacher support, engaging digital lessons, and diagnostic assessments. The program targets middle- and lower-secondary students (grades 5–8) as well as those entering high school with weak math foundations, and helps them build essential skills step by step.</p>
<h3><strong>Who this tool is for</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Students at risk of dropping out or underperforming in math, especially in grades 5–8.</li>
<li>Teachers working in rural and underserved schools.</li>
<li>Schools and ministries looking for scalable, low-cost remedial solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Foundational Teaching Skills (AFP modules):</strong></span> Eleven core skills for effective classroom practice, aligned with the World Bank’s TEACH framework. These include checking for understanding, feedback, adaptation, and building positive classroom climate.</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Student learning units:</strong></span> Ten structured units delivered over 30 weeks (approx. 45 hours), covering numbers, algebra, geometry, and data &amp; probability. Each unit blends short theory blocks, guided practice, and quick checks for understanding.</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lesson skeleton and tutorials:</strong></span> Consistent templates that link diagnostics (e.g., BRIO) to instruction, ensuring every session follows a predictable, student-centered routine.</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Diagnostic tool:</strong></span> Baseline and follow-up assessments (e.g., BRIO tests) that identify learning gaps from grades 5–8 and track progress.</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Teacher resource kits:</strong></span> Guides, examples, and AI-supported materials to help teachers plan and deliver lessons effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to use it</strong></h3>
<ol class="ordered-list">
<li class="p1">Run the diagnostic test to identify student needs and group them by skill gaps.</li>
<li>Deliver the 10 learning units across 30 weeks (1.5–2 hours per week), using the lesson skeleton as your guide.</li>
<li>Use the digital tutorials and the Relu avatar to demonstrate concepts and keep students engaged.</li>
<li>Monitor progress with built-in assessments at the end of each unit, and regroup students when needed.</li>
<li>Join webinars and training sessions to strengthen teacher practice and share experiences.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://edskills.org/how-to-guide-remedial-math-program/">For more detail, view the "how-to" guide for this program.</a></p>
<h3><strong>Time and effort</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Setup: Install program container on school servers or computers.</li>
<li>Instruction: 30 weeks of learning (approx. 45 hours total).</li>
<li>Support: 8 webinars offered during rollout.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Languages</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Available in <span class="s1"><strong>Romanian</strong></span>.</li>
<li>Adaptable to other languages with translation and subtitles.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Evidence and impact</strong></h3>
<p class="p3">Piloted in Romania under the PNRAS program, the Remedial Math Program directly addresses the skill gaps identified by national diagnostics and World Bank TEACH classroom observations. <br><br>BRIO assessments show that students struggle most with real numbers, data/graph interpretation, and early algebra. Teach classroom data highlight areas such as feedback, deeper thinking, and student collaboration. The program is designed to close these gaps through targeted instruction and consistent teaching practices. <br><br>Early results show that low-performing students can progress toward average performance levels, offering a more inclusive pathway through secondary education and reducing the need for private tutoring.</p>
